# Signal-Processing-Using-MATLAB
This repository contains MATLAB codes (files with ".m" extension) about concepts related to Signal Processing. 

These codes were written so as to visualise the concepts of Analog Signal Processing and also to get a hands-on-experience of viewing different types and forms of signals. Using my limited knowledge about MATLAB along help from various forums, GitHub repositories, I have managed to make these codes for everyone who is interested in Signal Processing.

MATLAB is one of the best softwares available currently which helps you in performing different types of mathematical operations, matrix manipulations, plotting graphs among other applications. Also the toolboxes available such as Signal Processing toolbox, Communications toolbox to name a few, help in efficient visualisation of signals.

There were many forums where people guide you regarding writing codes related to this topic in MATLAB. However, such resources are mostly dispersed and there aren't many sources where there is a collection of such codes. So, with this, I aim to make a repository which could have most of the codes related to Signal Processing.

How to use the project?
In order to use the codes present in the repository, you can download/copy-paste the codes in a new MATLAB script and run the script.
For this, you can download MATLAB from it's official webpage: https://in.mathworks.com/downloads/

Credits:
As mentioned earlier, this was not possible without the help of varied forums, GitHub repositories which I referred to while writing these codes. It is because of such resources that learning becomes a bit more enjoyable. I express my gratitude by mentioning some of the resources I closely followed:

1. https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/
2. https://github.com/Saptarshi-prog/DSBSC-simulation-by-MATLAB/tree/master
3. https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/121119-add-a-varying-phase-shift-to-a-sine-wave-linspace-involved

There are many such resources but unfortunately it isn't possible to list them all here. This doesn't imply that due credit is not given to any such of the resources.
